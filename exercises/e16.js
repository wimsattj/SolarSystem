/**
 * Make sure to read the e16.md file!
 * For this exercise we want you to make a custom `find` method. 
 * In order to do this it is ok to use any type of FOR loops.
 * REQUIREMENT: A find function should
 * * Take an array of things
 * * Return the first thing where the applied callback is truthy
 * The function MUST NOT use the find() method.

// === TEST YOURSELF ===
// Once you're finished run the test with "npm run test-16"
// If the test has all tests passed, switch to the next exercise file
// If any of the tests fails, refactor the code and run the test command after you've fixed the function
